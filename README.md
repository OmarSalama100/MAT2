# Matrix Calculator
It is a command-line program developed in C that allows users to perform various matrix operations. It supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, cofactor, determinant, and inverse.

The program was initially for the CS50X final project, and after that I added more features to make it better.

The program is organized into two main files:<br/>
* <i>matrix.h:</i> This file contains the core logic for all matrix operations. It handles the mathematical computations required for each operation.</br>
* <i>main.c:</i> This file manages user interactions, including input and output. It guides the user through selecting and performing operations on matrices and displays the results. Together, these files form a cohesive tool for working with matrices directly from the command line.>
